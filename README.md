## Examples
```C++
...
float3 position;
float3 scalation;
float3 axis;
float  angle;

// Initialize your transform

float4x4 translateMatrix = float4x4::translate(position);
float4x4 scalationMatrix = float4x4::scale(scalation);
float4x4 axisAngleMatrix = float4x4::rotate(axis, angle);

float4x4 modelMatrix = mul(mul(translateMatrix, scalationMatrix), axisAngleMatrix);
float4x4 projectionMatrix = float4x4::perspective(radian(45.0f), WIDTH / HEIGHT, 0.0f, 100.0f);
//float4x4 projectionMatrix = float4x4::ortho(0.0f, WIDTH, 0.0f, HEIGHT, 0.0f, 1.0f);

// Apply matrix to your render pipeline

> On the other hand, I would argue that using TDD on a math library is a bad idea. Itâ€™s essential to write good unit tests for a math library, but probably not to design it through TDD. Are you really going to implement a cross product differently just because you wrote tests before? The emphasis there has to be on correctness and performance, not on creating the interface or implementation through tests.

> Features
>   The Vector Math library mainly provides functions used in 3-D graphics for 3-D and 4-D vector operations, matrix operations, and quaternion operations. APIs for both the C and C++ programming languages are provided, along with three formats according to the data layout: 
>       - The AoS (Array of Structures) SIMD format, which can easily and quickly be adapted to handle different situations 
>       - The SoA (Structure of Arrays) SIMD format, which allows for maximum throughput 
>       - The scalar format, which is useful for porting and testing 
>   All three formats provide implementations for the PPU and SPU.
